# High Issues

## H-1: Weak Randomness

The use of keccak256 hash functions on predictable values like block.timestamp, block.number, or similar data, including modulo operations on these values, should be avoided for generating randomness, as they are easily predictable and manipulable. The `PREVRANDAO` opcode also should not be used as a source of randomness. Instead, utilize Chainlink VRF for cryptographically secure and provably random values to ensure protocol integrity.

	```

# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>4 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BmNft.sol [Line: 36](src/BmNft.sol#L36)

	```solidity
	contract BmNft is ERC721, Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/BmNft.sol [Line: 98](src/BmNft.sol#L98)

	```solidity
	    function mintToAddress(address to) external onlyOwner mintRequirements {
	```

- Found in src/BmNft.sol [Line: 108](src/BmNft.sol#L108)

	```solidity
	    function setPrice(uint256 newPrice) external onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/BmNft.sol [Line: 112](src/BmNft.sol#L112)

	```solidity
	    function withdraw() external payable onlyOwner {
	```

</details>



## L-2: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BmNft.sol [Line: 140](src/BmNft.sol#L140)

	```solidity
	    function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public pure override returns (string memory) {
	```

</details>



## L-3: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

- Found in src/BmNft.sol [Line: 51](src/BmNft.sol#L51)

	```solidity
	    event Minted(address indexed owner, uint256 tokenId);
	```

</details>



## L-4: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.28;
	```

</details>



## L-5: Modifiers invoked only once can be shoe-horned into the function



<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BmNft.sol [Line: 75](src/BmNft.sol#L75)

	```solidity
	    modifier ensureAvailability() {
	```

</details>



## L-6: Unused Custom Error

it is recommended that the definition be removed when custom error is unused

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BmNft.sol [Line: 53](src/BmNft.sol#L53)

	```solidity
	    error InsufficientFunds();
	```

- Found in src/BmNft.sol [Line: 55](src/BmNft.sol#L55)

	```solidity
	    error NoTokensToMintAvailable();
	```

- Found in src/BmNft.sol [Line: 56](src/BmNft.sol#L56)

	```solidity
	    error MintThroughContractUnavailable();
	```

</details>



## L-7: Costly operations inside loops.

Invoking `SSTORE`operations in loops may lead to Out-of-gas errors. Use a local variable to hold the loop computation result.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BmNft.sol [Line: 65](src/BmNft.sol#L65)

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 i = 1; i <= premintAmount; i++) {
	```

</details>



## L-8: State variable could be declared constant

State variables that are not updated following deployment should be declared constant to save gas. Add the `constant` attribute to state variables that never change.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BmNft.sol [Line: 49](src/BmNft.sol#L49)

	```solidity
	    uint256 private startRndCount = premint + 1;
	```

</details>



## L-9: State variable changes but no event is emitted.

State variable changes in this function but no event is emitted.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>

	```solidity
